# Welcome to Bioinfozone

Bioinfozone is learning platform , where you will learn bioinformatics with real world data examples.

```{note}
We are going understand concept of different omics analysis using bioinformatics tools by analyasing real world problems and some basic examples.

```

We are going to learn :
* Basics of Bioinformatics and Applications
* Basics of Linux 
* Python Basics and Advance
* R programming Basics and Advance
* Transcriptomics Analysis (Bulk and Single cell)
* Multimodal Analysis 
* Chipseq Analysis
* Variant analysis
* 16s Amplicon sequencing analysis
* Long read Analysis
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning
* Image Processing
* Drug Design
* Drug Target Interaction study 


1. **Single Cell Analysis**
In this we are going to learn how we can use Single cell Analysis using google colab.

Example we are going to use here is COVID-19 . Where we have 6 patients 3 from Covid-19 affected and 3 Normal patients.

Briefly we are going to learn :
Preprocessing of data :  where wecheck for different quality metrices of cells and correct for those metrices.

Normalize Data : Different Normalization methods to normalize gene metrix

Dimensionality reduction: Perform dimensionality reduction and selection of features

Data Integration : Checking Batch correction and correcting for batches.

Clustering : Performing clustering 

Cell Identification: Identifying cell types using Manual and Automated methods

Differential gene expression : Performing differential expression between Normal and Covid-19 affected patients.
